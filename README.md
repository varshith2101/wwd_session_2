1. MAKE REPO, upload html and css files.
2. create a codespace, download live server extension
3. 


important :
1. VERSION CONTROL
2. upload empty html & css files to a repository
3.  made the navbar
4.  commit changes -  i made changes, i want this reflect in the repository.
5.  i have a newer version, 


codespace = older version
repo -> newer

1. pull = fetching 
2. push = committing

empty 1.0
nav bar 1.1
nav bar & content 1.2 <- repo 

10th dec = empty page <br>
12th dec = push navbar ++code (repo was updated)<br>
13th dev = on their view, or on their vs code, local no changes, <br>
    1. check for version, check for updates<br>
    2. fetch changes, pull changes<br>
    3. on top of that, after navbar, add content <br>
    4. push to the repo ( their pc 1.2, yours is at 1.1)<br>
    5. fetch from repo (both of you have 1.2)<br>


the way wiki is build from scratch
 1. wwd subsystem -> template //im gonna teach
 2. word file -> content
 3. replace template placeholder with actual content from documents
 4. divide work accordingly
 5. back to wwd
 6. add a file in repo, push the changes
 7. fix minor issues, italicise, bold
